<!-- I tightened up my Code and used the proper tab formatting for easier reading.
I also tried to make everything shrink up nice to see what it looks like on a Phone and Tablet.
Looks really sharp on the phone! Clearly I am a huge Fan of color and design and did not
go with the standard Format. -->

<div class="main"><h1 class="lesson">Lesson One</h1> Web and HTML Basics
	<div class="content">
		<div>
			<h1 class="lesson">HTTP</h1>
			 Users will send a HTTP (e.g. <b>http</b>://yourdomain.com)
		<p> request from their powser via a device or PC.
		<p> The request travels from your PC to a Data Server,
		<p> looking up the address you requested.
		<p> The Server finds the index.html and pings it
		<p> back to your powser.
		<p> Your powser renders the HTML code to a visual
		<p> mark up that you can see.
		<p><p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h1 class="lesson">HTML</h1>
			 HTML or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>
		<p> It determines how it is going to look,
		<p> e.g. layout, design.
		<p><p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h1 class="lesson">Tags and Elements</h1>
			      HTML is made of Tags and Elements witch
			 <p> in turn have attributes within.
			 <p> powsers know what type of element to utilize
			 <p> with use of Tags.

		<div>
			<h1 class="lesson">HTML Structure</h1>
			     The "tree-like structure" reminds me of the folder
			<p> structure of a computer.
			<p> It is panched out in the same way,
			<p> starting from the root folder.
			<p> There are folders within folders
			<p> a hundred times over.

		<div>
			<h1 class="lesson">Indented HTML</h1>
	             Indented HTML helps coders to see clearly
	        <p> the structure of the page.
	        <p> I soon found that out on my own.
	        <p> My first code was quite messy and
	        <p> gave me a headache just searching
	        <p> through it.
	        <p> With proper coding I can tell box's are in
	        <p> other box's at a glance.
	        <p> Works like a Flow Chart.

			<h1 class="lesson">Text Editors</h1>
				 Some text editors have the ability
			<p> to display several types of code languages.
			<p> They highlight the code appropriately according
			<p> to the language you select
			<p> (thats super cool by the way!)
			<p> They can also use Telesense to help you lay down code.
			<p> The same type of thing your cell phone does
			<p> when you text people.
			<p> Sublime is cool, and someone told me Notepad 2
			<p> is good. I have not verified the latter.

<div class="main"><h1 class="lesson">Lesson Three</h1> Adding CSS
	<div class="content">
		<div>
			<h1 class="lesson">Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
			      At first I had classes defined within tags,
			 <p> I then deployed the Style tag noticing it used
			 <p> packets the same as the code in the css sheet.
			 <p> I started adding new div classes to my sheet.
			 <p> You can probably guess that my various ways
			 <p> of styling the page got quite complicated.
			 <p> This is when I realized just how important
			 <p> non repetitive coding really is.
			 <p> Hopefully this code will be a good
			 <p> example of complicated code simplified.
